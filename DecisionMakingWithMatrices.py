# Decision making with Matrices
# This is a pretty simple assingment.  You will do something you do everyday, but today it will be with matrix manipulations. 
# The problem is: you and your work firends are trying to decide where to go for lunch. You have to pick a resturant thats best for everyone.  Then you should decided if you should split into two groups so eveyone is happier.  
# Displicte the simplictiy of the process you will need to make decisions regarding how to process the data.
 # This process was thoughly investigated in the operation research community.  This approah can prove helpful on any number of decsion making problems 
 # that are currently not leveraging machine learning.

# Next compute a new matrix (M_usr_x_rest  i.e. an user by restaurant) from all people.  What does the a_ij matrix represent? 

# Sum all columns in M_usr_x_rest to get optimal restaurant for all users.  What do the entryâ€™s represent?

# Now convert each row in the M_usr_x_rest into a ranking for each user and call it M_usr_x_rest_rank.   
# Do the same as above to generate the optimal resturant choice.  

# Why is there a difference between the two?  What problem arrives?  What does represent in the real world?

# How should you preprocess your data to remove this problem. 

# Find  user profiles that are problematic, explain why?

# Think of two metrics to compute the disatistifaction with the group.  

# Should you split in two groups today? 

# Ok. Now you just found out the boss is paying for the meal. How should you adjust. Now what is best restaurant?

# Tommorow you visit another team. You have the same restaurants and they told you their optimal ordering for restaurants.  
# Can you find their weight matrix?
