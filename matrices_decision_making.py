# Decision making with Matrices
# This is a pretty simple assingment.  You will do something you do everyday, but today it will be with matrix manipulations. 
# The problem is: you and your work firends are trying to decide where to go for lunch. You have to pick a resturant thats best for everyone.  Then you should decided if you should split into two groups so eveyone is happier.  
# Displicte the simplictiy of the process you will need to make decisions regarding how to process the data.
 # This process was thoughly investigated in the operation research community.  This approah can prove helpful on any number of decsion making problems 
 # that are currently not leveraging machine learning.

# Why is there a difference between the two?  What problem arrives?  What does represent in the real world?
"""
The first method is summing all the scores each restaurant received from people, this 
   maintains the range and skewness of the scores.   (Example: Rest1 received a score of 100 and 1000 = tot score 1100,
   while rest2 got a score of 200 and 150 = tot score 350)

The second method is summing the ranks each restaurant received from the people. This removes the skewness and range 
   of the scores. (Example: rest 1 received ranks of 2 and  1 = tot score = 3, rest 2 received ranks of 1  and 2 = tot score 3)

The problem is that the first model is sensitive to outliers on the scores (scores are not ordinal), 
   while the second method is using ordinal vlaues (rank) and is ignoring the magnitude of the socres.

So, in the real world, a person can influence the ranking of the first model by creating a wide difference in the scores across restaurants. (rest1=100, rest2=1000)

The ranked based model (model 2) removes such problem, but is ignoring the magnitude of the scoring. If two restaurants 
   have a very similar score, may receive a very distand rankings (while we want them close on the ranking)

"""
#%% QUESTION 7
# How should you preprocess your data to remove this problem. 
"""
The problem  is caused by the skewness of the scores made by each person. 
A good method to remove skewness is to LOG-transform the score. The Log will make the scoring distribution more normal, hence
  the final ranking can still be basesd on scores (method 1) and we have mitigate extreme skewess (or bias) of the data.

#%% QUESTION 11
# Ok. Now you just found out the boss is paying for the meal. How should you adjust. Now what is best restaurant?
"""
It depends if we have a constrained budget or not. If we have higher budget, the weight associate with cost preference (people matrix) 
may be lowerd. Otherwise, if we have a constrained budget (like the boss is paying from his/her money) we need to increase the
cost weight in the poeple matrix.

For this exercise we are assuming the boss is paying from her money, hence we want to be cost conscious. We proceed by
adjusting the cost weight on the poeple matrix to 5
